Homework #4 Collaboration File

Alfonso Villalobos - 30
Binh Trinh	   - 40
Sebastian Valencia - 30

Code was implemented from previous homeworks 1 & 2 which was taken from Binh Trinh's work since
he had recieved a better grade in those assignments and it was more developed in terms of completness.

The homework was divided up in the beginning of the process as Binh and Sebastian worked on the user input and "scrapping" of the
input file in order to use the data, the user interface (such as the the menues and prompts), and BankSimulator Class. 

Binh alone also worked on the writing of the file as well as getRange, balance, and methods in the BST class.

Alfonso wrote test methods to help with the code development, along with working on the modification of the Bank class.
